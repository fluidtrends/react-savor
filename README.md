# Overview

Savor gives you all you need to write amazing tests for your React Apps, right out of the box, all in one place: a test framework, BDD and TDD assertions, stubbing/mocking, code coverage and static analysis.

Savor uses the following Open-Source libraries to make that happen:

 - [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) as the test framework
 - [Chai](http://chaijs.com) as the assertion library (both for BDD and for TDD)
 - [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org) as the stubbing library
 - [Istanbul](http://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul) as the code coverage tool
 - [ESLint](http://eslint.org) as the static analyzer
 - [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) as the React testing framework

Enjoy!
